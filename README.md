# SICP

`Super Illegal Chinchilla Party`

This repository contains the mortal remains of my quest
to reach 100% SICP completion. 

It contains solutions (often with explanations!) of all
of the exercises in the latest edition of sicp, as well
as various helper scripts, my reflections, and a variety
of illustrations.

## Progress [<sup>1</sup>](#fn1)

```
Chapter 1 [===============] 100%
Chapter 2 [=============  ]  89%
Chapter 3 [=              ]   8%

```

## Resources

Where to get SICP:
* [Read it in emacs!](https://github.com/webframp/sicp-info)
* [Or use the online edition](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html)
* [Or read it old school :)](https://www.amazon.com/Structure-Interpretation-Computer-Programs-Engineering/dp/0262510871)
  * I purchased my copy from used book store on Amazon in exchange for a measly **singular cent!**[<sup>2</sup>](#fn2). 
    I was naturally supremely pleased with myself, up until the point I realized that I had essentially paid them to ship me trash...
    at which point I became absolutely ecstatic!
