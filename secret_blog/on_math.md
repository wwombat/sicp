# --- ON MATH ---

Let's not beat around the bush - MATH is REALLY REALLY HARD!

To those who, the present author included, are not one of those lucky few
blessed by Nuggin with preternatural intelligence, encounters with MATH can
leave even the stoutest of softies in a gloopy puddle of disenheartened
sadditude. Many of us have even had the unfortunate experience of this pain
metastasizing over the years into part of our identities, the name "NOT A MATH
PERSON" implanting itself firmly in our brains.

Now, I would like to impress upon you some facts:

    1) You DON'T need to be a REAL-DEAL Math-person to be a programmer!

    2) You DON'T need to be a REAL-DEAL Math-person to be a good programmer!

    3) You DON'T need to be a REAL-DEAL Math-person to be a GREAT programmer!

    4) A dirty secret -> You DON'T need to be a REAL_DEAL Math-person to
    >>> USE MATH <<<

Of course, there ~are~ real differences in mathematical ability: to pretend
that MATH is purely a byproduct of hard work would give our efforts the 
air of a sham[1]. Real "Math People" do exist, and you probably know many of 
their names: Feynman, Van Neuman, Einstein, Ramanujan, etc. And you have 
probably run into a fair number in your life - people whose minds seemed to race
ahead of yours, and who take to Math like fish to water.

In order to be a good programmer (even a Great Programmer!) you do NOT need to
make mathematical discoveries! Let me repeat that- you do NOT You do not need to
make mathematical discoveries any more than you need to be an acclaimed novelist
to learn how to love and live more richly from Victorian novels, or a master
painter to swoon in front of a Michelangelo <link> or a Matisse <link>, or
totally bonkers with love of the universe to try out instructions from
Yoko Ono's Grapefruit <link>.

The ability to APPLY mathematical discoveries to one's work is an option
available to everyone, no genius required!!

For some people, getting help from someone who already gets it is all they need!
But, for others, "help" can have the opposite effect: doing Math with someone
who is significantly 'math-IQ-smarter' than you can be bruising to the soul!

The key is to persevere in the face of not-getting it!

    1) Know stuff
    2) Recognize stuff
    3) Use stuff

The goal is to learn general categories of math things!

When one listens to music, one builds up a library of sounds and styles: and
almost like magic, you subconsciously begin to get ~feelings~ about these
styles. When you hear a piece of music, you get a feeling about what type of
music it is- what "rules" of sound were invoked to creat it. Just like how you
can learn to recognize genres of music (something can ~feel~ hip-hop, or
~country~, or ~rock~, or ~baroque~, etc. etc.), you can learn to ~feel~
different categories of Mathematical things! MATH being a fundamental reflection
of reality notwithstanding, recognizing when you can use Mathematical results
isn't any different from recognizing anything else!

The eventual goal is "this feels _____-y" - -this- ~feels~ like -that-!

So, are you ready? Are you DETERMINED? :3
Then let's get to it!!!

1) WHAT IS MATH?

MATH is, all quibbly definitions aside, one thing: it is nothing more than
thinking about what MUST BE.
